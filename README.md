# Kubernetes STRTA Demo

A small demo to demonstrate getting a Spring Boot (Kotlin) app deployed onto a 
Kubernetes cluster using Docker for Mac, whilst following the STRTA project pattern.

## Getting Started
Run `./script/build` to build the app's Docker image

Followed by running `./script/server -d` to deploy the app onto Kubernetes and to start
it up.
